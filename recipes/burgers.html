    <h2>How to Make a Delicous Juicy Bacon Cheeseburger</h2>
    <p>The Cheeseburger: The ultimate American street food! Ever since I was a kid I have loved bacon cheeseburgers. 
        On any given day, I would consider a bacon cheeseburger to be my favorite entree. 
        The juiciness of the burger patty, the melty creamy American cheese, the freshness of the lettuce and tomato, 
        the bite of the onion, the smokey crispy bacon and the condiments that give it that final touch of sharpness and sweetness make it a satisfying experience that pack Americana, nostalgia and satisfaction into the palm of a messy hand!</p>
    <p><em><strong>Is your mouth watering yet?</strong> </em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients List (Serves 8)
    </h2>
    <p> Before I get into the ingredients list, I want to point out that burgers became famous because they are cheap, savory and delicous. 
        But there has been a trend of restaraunteurs <em>elevating</em> the burger to something it was never intended to be. 
        I forgo the expenive ingredients such as grass fed beef, applewood bacon and aged cheddar. 
        You are probably going to load up your burger with lots of condiments and toppings and 
        you won't be able to discern whether you are eating expensive or cheap ingredients </p>
    <h3>The Meat</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs 80/20% Ground Beef </li>
        <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>2 Tbs Worchestershire Sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp Chipotle Chili Powder</li>
        <li>1 Cup Plain Bread Crumbs</li>
        <li>Montreal Seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Buns and Toppings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Burger buns: I recommend either Potato Buns or Trader Joe's Brioche Bread </li>
        <li>Iceburg lettuce</li>
        <li>Fresh Tomato (don't cheap out here. Get the best tomatoes at the store)</li>
        <li>Bacon</li>
        <li>Sweet white onion</li>
        <li>sliced pickles</li>
        <li>Heinz Yellow Mustard (Not Deli Mustard!)</li>
        <li>Heinz Ketchup</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the ground beef and place in a large mixing bowl</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, bread crumbs, Worchestershire sauce and Chipotle powder</li>
        <li>Use hands to mix thoroughly</li>
        <li> Using a food scale, weigh out the meat in grams then divide by 6</li>
        <li>Pat out 6 burgers of equal weight. Burgers will shrink in size so make them about an inch thick.
            Don't compress too much! Be gentle</li>
            
    </ol>

    <p>*<strong><em>Pro tips</em></strong></stron></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't overly compress your patties. It will make them too dense</li>
        <li>Use a thermometer! Don't let pride get in the way. You don't have xray vision. 
            When the patty hits about 145 degrees (F), pull it</li>
        <li>Add the cheese as soon as you pull it from the grill 
            but don't delay or you won't have enough residual heat to melt it</li>
        <li>You can pan fry or grill your burgers. Pan frying gives 
            a lot of temperature control and you will really taste the meat. 
        Grilling over charcoal with a little wood makes it harder to control the temperature but gives a great smokey flavor</li>
    </ul>

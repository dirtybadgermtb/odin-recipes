    <h2>How to Make a Delicous Juicy Bacon cheeseburger</h2>
    <p>Ever since I was a kid I have loved bacon cheeseburgers. On any given day, I would consider a bacon cheeseburger to be my favorite entree. The juiciness of the burger patty, the melty creamy American cheese, the freshness of the lettuce and tomato, the bite of the onion, the smokey crispy bacon and the condiments that give it that final touch of sharpness and sweetness make is a satisfying experience that pack Americana, nostalgia and satisfaction into the palm of a messy hand!</p>

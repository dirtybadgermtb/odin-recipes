    <h2>Mom's Classic Grilled Cheese Sandwich</h2>
  
    <p>Sometimes something a simple dish can be all you need to bring feelings of nostalgia and happiness to a dreary day.
        One of my childhood favorites is still a go-to meal when I need something
    hot, melty and savory </p>

    <p><em><strong>Are you longing for Mom's Grilled Cheese?</strong> </em></p>
    <h3>Ingredients List (Serves 1)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Two slices of Martin's Potato Bread (any white bread will do but this is a household staple)</li>
        <li>1 slice of American Cheese</li>
        <li>1 pats of butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat frying pan or cast iron skillet on medium heat until it sizzles a drop of water</li>
        <li>Butter one side of each slice of bread with a pat of butter</li>
        <li>Place the first slice of bread butter side down in hot pan</li>
        <li>Then place slice of American cheese on the bread</li>
        <li>Place second slice over the cheese, butter side up</li>
        <li>Using your spatula, lift the edge of the sandwich about every minute and flip once it is golden brown</li>
        <li>Repeat with side 2</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong><em>Quick Tip:</em></strong>You don't want to cook it too fast or the bread will turn 
        golden brown before the cheese is completely melted
    </p>

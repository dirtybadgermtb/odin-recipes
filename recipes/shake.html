    <h2>Nutritious & Delicous Breakfast in Under 5 Minutes!</h2>
    <p><strong><em>“If You Fail to Plan, You Are Planning to Fail” — Benjamin Franklin</em></strong></p>
    <p>Like so many of us, my mornings can be hectic trying to get in exercise, planning my workday, 
        taking care my dog and getting a kid to school on time. 
        I don't always have the time or desire to fix a proper breakfast. This is a recipe for a shake that from start to finish takes 5 minutes.
    I know because I have timed it. And it tastes delicous! </p>

    <p><em><strong>So keep reading if you have mornings like mine!</strong> </em></p>
    <h3>Ingredients List (Serves 1)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 oz Unsweetened Almond Milk (cow's milk, oat milk, and soy milk are also fine) </li>
        <li>1 banana</li>
        <li>1 scoop chocolate flavored whey Protein</li>
        <li>2 Tbs PB Fit Peanut butter Protein Powder</li>
        <li>1 cup of fresh or frozen berries</li>
        <li>1 cup of frozen spinach</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the banana, whey, PB Fit, spinach and berries in your bullet blender</li>
        <li>Pour almond milk in last</li>
        <li>Blend until smooth</li>
    </ol>

    <p>And that is it! You can drink it as you get ready for work,
        slam it before you go out the door, or drink during your commute.
    </p>
